# Product Context: Nahalal Pool Registration

## Why This Project Exists

The pool has limited capacity and must manage registrations to avoid overcrowding. Manual registration is inefficient and error-prone. This app automates the process, ensuring fair access and easy management for both users and admins.

## Problems Solved

- Prevents overbooking of pool time slots
- Ensures users can only register for allowed time groups
- Provides admins with tools to manage slots, users, and reports
- Offers transparency to all users about slot availability

## User Experience Goals

- Frictionless registration and login for regular users
- Simple, secure admin access
- Clear, real-time display of available slots and registrations
- Easy cancellation and management of registrations
- Mobile-friendly, accessible design
