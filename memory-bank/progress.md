# Progress

## What Works

- All major user/admin flows functional (registration, slot management, user management, reports, shared table, etc.)
- Supabase CRUD fully integrated for all data operations
- Session/auth, validation, and feedback flows are robust
- Table and registration UX is modern and accessible
- **Common utilities (feedback, hashing, CSV, color, date logic) are now centralized in js/utils.js and used throughout the codebase**

## What's Left

- Ongoing: monitor for further refactor/utility opportunities
- Ongoing: feature requests, bugfixes, and documentation

## Current Status

- Codebase is DRY, modular, and easy to maintain
- All known duplicate logic for feedback, hashing, CSV, and color is removed
- Memory bank and documentation are up to date

## Known Issues

- None related to utility extraction or refactor
