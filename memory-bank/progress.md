# Progress: Nahalal Pool Registration

## What Works

- Project requirements and context documented
- Tech stack and system patterns defined

## What's Left to Build

- Database schema and Supabase setup
- Static frontend (HTML, JS, CSS)
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Admin and regular user UI
- Registration, cancellation, and reporting features

## Current Status

- Planning and documentation phase

## Known Issues

- No backend server may limit some advanced logic/reporting
- Supabase RLS and triggers must be carefully designed for security
