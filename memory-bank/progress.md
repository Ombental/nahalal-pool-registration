# Progress (as of reset)

## What Works

- User CSV upload (with correct parsing and field mapping)
- User table display (with names array)
- Admin can remove individual names from registrations in the table view
- Published/unpublished slot management (edit, actions, readable tables)
- Registration table (user view) is responsive and clean
- All table UIs are modern and mobile-friendly
- Registration form uses dropdowns for names, each name can only be selected once, and users can add/remove name dropdowns dynamically

## What's Left

- (Optional) Confirmation dialogs for destructive admin actions
- (Optional) More granular admin reporting or analytics
- (Optional) User feedback for CSV upload errors (per-row)
- (Optional) Editing names for existing users

## Current Status

- All core admin and user flows are robust and visually polished
- Database and frontend are in sync
- Registration form is user-friendly and prevents duplicate name selection
- Ready for further feature requests or deployment

## Known Issues

- None related to utility extraction or refactor
