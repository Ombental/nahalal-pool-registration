# Active Context (as of reset)

## Registration Form Validation (2024-06, FINAL)

- Users can register for multiple time slots in the same time group.
- Each name from the user's "names" field can only appear once in a time group (across all slots in that group).
- If all names are used in a group, time slots from that group are hidden in the form.
- The form, dropdowns, and validation logic are fully aligned with this logic.
- All legacy restrictions on one registration per group are removed.

## Recent Major Changes

- Registration form is robust, user-friendly, and prevents duplicate name selection per group.
- Admin/user/registration table improvements and all previous context remain current.

## Current State

- Registration and admin flows are robust and visually polished.
- Database and frontend are in sync.
- Ready for further feature requests or deployment.

## Current Focus

- Codebase refactor for maintainability and DRY principles.
- Extraction of common JS utilities into a single module.

## Current State

- All user management is via CSV upload.
- Admins can manage time slots and registrations with improved UI.
- Table views are modern, responsive, and admin features are robust.
- Registration form is user-friendly, prevents duplicate name selection, and supports dynamic add/remove.
- Database schema and migrations are up to date (users.names text[]).

## Next Steps

- Monitor for further utility extraction opportunities.
- Continue modularizing and documenting as new features are added.
- Further admin controls, confirmation dialogs, or reporting as needed.
- Continue to maintain UI/UX consistency and security.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Table is rectangular and visually consistent regardless of slot configuration.
- All scroll and sticky header logic is handled via CSS for reliability.
- No pending refactors or technical debt in this area.

## Insights

- User experience for viewing large numbers of slots is now much improved.
- The table is now robust for both admins and regular users.
