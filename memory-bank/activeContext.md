# Active Context (as of reset)

## Registration Form Validation (2024-06, FINAL)

- Users can register for multiple time slots in the same time group.
- Each name from the user's "names" field can only appear once in a time group (across all slots in that group).
- If all names are used in a group, time slots from that group are hidden in the form.
- The form, dropdowns, and validation logic are fully aligned with this logic.
- All legacy restrictions on one registration per group are removed.

## Recent Major Changes

- Registration form is robust, user-friendly, and prevents duplicate name selection per group.
- Admin/user/registration table improvements and all previous context remain current.

## Current State

- Registration and admin flows are robust and visually polished.
- Database and frontend are in sync.
- Ready for further feature requests or deployment.

## Current Focus

**Summery Pool Vibe UI Overhaul**

### Design Goals

- Color Palette: Pool blues (gradient backgrounds, buttons), sunny yellows (accents, highlights).
- Imagery: Pool, water, sun, floaties, beach balls, waves, etc.
- Icons: Use SVGs or icon fonts for water, sun, swimmers, etc.
- Backgrounds: Subtle pool/wave patterns, floating icons, or soft gradients.
- Typography: Friendly, rounded, summery font (e.g., Google Fonts "Varela Round" or similar).
- Component Polish: Buttons, cards, tables, and forms should feel "summery" and inviting.

### Implementation Plan

#### A. Global Styles

- Add/override Tailwind config or custom CSS for blue gradients and yellow accents.
- Set a background gradient for the body (e.g., light blue to deeper blue).
- Add floating SVG icons/images (e.g., floaties, waves, sun) as background elements (absolute/fixed, low opacity).

#### B. Layout & Components

- Headers: Add a pool/sun icon next to main titles.
- Buttons: Use blue/yellow gradients, rounded, with subtle shadow.
- Cards/Forms: Add soft blue backgrounds, maybe a "pool tile" pattern or wave border.
- Tables: Blue header rows, yellow highlights for important actions.

#### C. Imagery & Icons

- Use SVGs for pool/summer icons (sun, waves, floaties, etc.).
- Place icons in corners/backgrounds, and next to relevant text (e.g., sun by logout, swimmer by registration).
- Consider a subtle animated wave or floating effect for background icons.

#### D. Polish

- Add hover/active effects with yellow highlights.
- Use a friendly, rounded font for all text.
- Ensure all changes are RTL-friendly and mobile responsive.

### Execution Steps

1. Add/Update Global CSS: gradients, backgrounds, icon placement, summery font.
2. Update HTML Layouts: background divs for floating icons/SVGs, icons in headers and buttons.
3. Update Component Styles: buttons, cards, tables, forms with new color scheme and rounded corners.
4. Test Responsiveness & RTL.
5. (Optional) Add subtle animations: floating icons, wave movement, button hover effects.

## Current State

- All user management is via CSV upload.
- Admins can manage time slots and registrations with improved UI.
- Table views are modern, responsive, and admin features are robust.
- Registration form is user-friendly, prevents duplicate name selection, and supports dynamic add/remove.
- Database schema and migrations are up to date (users.names text[]).

## Next Steps

- Monitor for further utility extraction opportunities.
- Continue modularizing and documenting as new features are added.
- Further admin controls, confirmation dialogs, or reporting as needed.
- Continue to maintain UI/UX consistency and security.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Table is rectangular and visually consistent regardless of slot configuration.
- All scroll and sticky header logic is handled via CSS for reliability.
- No pending refactors or technical debt in this area.

## Insights

- User experience for viewing large numbers of slots is now much improved.
- The table is now robust for both admins and regular users.
