# Active Context (Updated)

## Current Work Focus

- User-facing shared table view for upcoming time slots.
- Ensuring table is visually clear, scrollable, and accessible for all slot configurations.

## Recent Changes

- Table navigation arrows now move by 1 slot at a time.
- Table always displays rows equal to the highest max participants among visible slots.
- For slots with fewer max participants, extra cells are blacked out.
- Table container now scrolls vertically (max-height: 60vh, overflow-y: auto).
- Table headers are sticky for better usability.
- All changes tested and confirmed working in browser.

## Next Steps

- Awaiting further feedback or new feature requests.
- No known issues with the table view.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Table is rectangular and visually consistent regardless of slot configuration.
- All scroll and sticky header logic is handled via CSS for reliability.
- No pending refactors or technical debt in this area.

## Insights

- User experience for viewing large numbers of slots is now much improved.
- The table is now robust for both admins and regular users.
